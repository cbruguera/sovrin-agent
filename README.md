# sovrin-agent

This is an experimental reference implementation of a Sovrin Agent. A 
Sovrin Agent is a persistent internet addressable endpoint dedicated to supporting 
the interactions of an individual or organization. Sovrin Agents are not required to 
interact with others or with the Sovrin network. A Sovrin Agent could provide 
services for its owner, such as monitoring, notification, messaging, backups, 
and interacting with the Sovrin Distributed Identity Ledger.
